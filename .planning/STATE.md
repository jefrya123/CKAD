# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** Unlimited, free, real-cluster CKAD practice with automated validation
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation + Cluster

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation + Cluster)
Plan: 1 of TBD in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Plan 01-01 complete: project scaffold + cluster lifecycle

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] ~5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-cluster | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2 min)
- Trend: baseline established

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and architecture.md ADRs.
Key decisions affecting current work:

- All phases: Pure bash, no build step — source is the product
- Phase 1: Fat cluster (Calico + ingress + metrics-server) to match real CKAD exam environment (ADR-04)
- Phase 2: Hybrid typed checks + command_output escape hatch (ADR-01); single-check no retry (ADR-07)
- Phase 3: Subcommand model, no TUI (ADR-02); PROMPT_COMMAND timer (ADR-10); additive-only progress schema (ADR-05)
- Phase 4: Exam mode as distinct component with separate session state (ADR-11)

**From 01-01 execution:**
- error() is print-only (no exit) — keeps lib functions composable; callers decide on exit
- Calico installed via manifest-only method (calico.yaml) — simpler than operator method for Phase 1
- Lib files use `# shellcheck shell=bash` directive (no shebang) + `# shellcheck disable=SC2034` for shared constants

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- PRD at docs/prd.md still references Go/Bubble Tea — architecture.md is source of truth, PRD needs update
- Learn mode detailed UX (lesson navigation, progression) not fully specified — design during Phase 5 planning
