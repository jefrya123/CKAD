## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table and architecture.md ADRs.
Key decisions affecting current work:

- All phases: Pure bash, no build step — source is the product
- Phase 1: Fat cluster (Calico + ingress + metrics-server) to match real CKAD exam environment (ADR-04)
- Phase 2: Hybrid typed checks + command_output escape hatch (ADR-01); single-check no retry (ADR-07)
- Phase 3: Subcommand model, no TUI (ADR-02); PROMPT_COMMAND timer (ADR-10); additive-only progress schema (ADR-05)
- Phase 4: Exam mode as distinct component with separate session state (ADR-11)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- PRD at docs/prd.md still references Go/Bubble Tea — architecture.md is source of truth, PRD needs update
- Learn mode detailed UX (lesson navigation, progression) not fully specified — design during Phase 5 planning
